Coding Patterns
1.Sliding Window
window size will increase by right pointer and left pointer will decrease according to the conditions of the problem
linear data structure (linkedlist,array,string)
longest/shortest substring,subarray,desiredValue
https://github.com/Vishu1234-bit/leetcode/new/main?filename=README.md

2.Two Pointers or iterators
two pointers iterate thru data structure until one or both of pointers meet or hit a certain condition
deal with sorted arrays/linkedlists
find set of elements(pair,triplet,subarray)

3.BFS(Breadth first search)
pushing root node to queue and continually iterating until queue is empty. we remove node at head of queue and visit the node. after removing each node from queue we also insert children to queue
tree in level order traversal ( level by level )

6.DFS(Depth first search)
Recursion to keep track of all parent nodes while traversing
Decide whether to do in inorder,preorder, postorder traversal
searching for something where the node is closer to leaf
https://github.com/Vishu1234-bit/leetcode/blob/main/Delete_Nodes_And_Return_Forest.py
https://github.com/Vishu1234-bit/leetcode/blob/main/Find_all_the_lonely_nodes.py

7.Fast and slow pointer
two pointers(Fast -move 2 at a time slow -move 1 at a time) 
loop in linked list
find certain element /length of linked list

8.Merge Intervals
deal with overlapping intervals
6 cases 
1. a,b do not overlap
2. a,b overlap b ends after a
3. a completely overlaps b
4. a,b overlap a ends after b
5. b completely overlaps a
6. a and b do not overlap
mutually exclusive intervals


7.Design Problems

8.In place reversal of linked list
